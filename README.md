# SumoBot

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to make a sumo robot which can fight with other sumo robots in a designated black ring with white tape around
its borders. Sumobot has two light sensors to check the white tape to avoid going out of the ring and one sonar sensor to determine the
distance between the sumobot itself and the its opponent.

In this project I used CHIRP Mini circuit board which is designed by John Rampelt. The header file (CHRPmini.h) and CHRPmini.c files are
written by him with small customizations by me to make it compatible for my project. I used Microchip's PIC16F886 micro-controller. Thus,
PIC16F886.c file is written by the company. I used their IDE MPLab to develop this project.

## Improvements After This Project
I also programed another circuit board to use the Sumobot remotly when I don't get the chance to fight with other robots. I will post
remote control's code in another repository.

## What I Learned From This Project
- Working with MPLab
- Working with micro-controllers
- Designing a fully automated robot
- Working with circuit boards
- How to use sonar sensor to navigate and calculate distance
- Working with IR sensors and light sensors
